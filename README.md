# Restored and cleaned version of new_banking

Based on NewWayRP's and onlyserenity's projects:

https://github.com/onlyserenity/new_banking

https://github.com/NewWayRP/new_banking

## Requirements
- legacy version of [es_extended](https://github.com/esx-framework/es_extended/tree/v1-final)

## My updates:
- Renamed the resource to reflect it's dependency on es_extended
- Replaced old format descriptor with the new one
- Modified the directory structure and file naming conventions to more closely match those used in esx projects
- Added proper localization of lua files
- Replaced the graph that contained 'real life' company logos with a more generic banner (hey, this is GTA!)
- Changed map blip colors to 'Fleeca Bank green'
- Fixed a bug with transaction result alert being under the main window and only partially visible
- Reduced the time transaction result alert is on screen from 5 to 3 seconds
